the Pizza Bus tour because of all of the great reviews here.Dear Internets: These people are not lying. You need to take this tour.Here is why:It is fun! I admit that I was a little curious why I needed to pay some dude to send me to pizza places in NYC when I can google my own. Remember going on field trips? The pizza bus is exactly like that. It's a nice escape; you feel silly and different on a bus full of adults there to eat pizza!Scott is enthusiastic and the fun he's having is infectious. He treats everyone on the tour like you're his friends and you're at his birthday party- complete with goodie bags!It is educational. If you enjoy cooking shows- specifically Alton Brown- this is a great tour for you. Scott has all of the answers to the science behind pizza, and he has a way of conveying that information in a manner that isn't stiff and boring.And what he teaches you sticks in your mind afterward- I can't tell you how many tours I've been on that seem like a long rambling of facts that go in one ear and out the other. On Scott's tour, you actually retain the knowledge because you can see it applied in a practical manner.The pizza and the pizza makers. It is awesome to see the relationships Scott has cultivated with the owners. On our tour (which was on Mother's Day) we had the pleasure of meeting Scott's mom who told us that places call him to be on the tour, but he only takes us to places that meet his criteria. It is incredible that not only has he researched pizza and pizza history so thoroughly, he has also curated a list of places where the owners &amp; employees not only know his name but actually love him. That friendliness adds to the great ambiance of the tour.I enjoyed trying the different kinds of pizza and comparing notes with the other tour members. It was interesting to see what pizzas New Yorkers on the tour liked vs others from different parts of the country- and guess what? Scott even had answers for why that was!After a weekend of walking around Manhattan, it was great to unwind and relax on the bus. You will be in good hands on this tour- I can't recommend it highly enough!", "rating": 5, "name": "Natalie W."}, {"selected": true, "review": "If you're a pizza lover this is a must do activity while you are in New York.We did the Greenwich Village pizza tour (mostly because it was only one available during the week in April). We had a group of about 16 and Scott himself conducted the tour. I've never met any tour guide on any tour I've ever taken that had as much knowledge, passion and enthusiasm as Scott. He is a Pizza encyclopedia and a Pizza fanatic.We had a fantastic time on a beautiful April NY day visiting 3 pizza places and enjoying three completely different styles of pizza and talking all about pizza from how to make it, ingredients, history, where to go and anything else you can think about pizza.If you love pizza, don't miss this tour!!! I'm going to go again next time I'm in NYC", "rating": 5, "name": "P G."}, {"selected": true, "review": "On a recent trip to NYC from Dallas, there was one thing I knew I had to do for my 29th Birthday. Scott's Pizza Tours. Yes.Now home from my trip in NYC and a month has passed, there is one thing that I remember most from my visit and its meeting Scott, the tour, and sharing his passion for naples style new york pizza.This whole thing was an amazing treat. With less than 15 in my group (we did the BUS tour, the only way to go!!) we got a really intimate experience. We tasted coal, wood and gas ovens in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn.Learning all of the facts about pizza... and why it is what is is, fascinated me. Along the way we got to see a part of NYC that most tourists never stop to look at, and really feel like we were a part of the local community for a few hours.This tour is not cheap, but Scott is worth every penny. I really loved this Tour and felt like I had met an old friend. God Bless you Scott and your love for pizza.

That said, the tour had no where to go but up in my expectations, but I am so happy to report that not only is Scott a dynamic, spirited, and interesting guy, but that his interest in history and pizza is not only strong, but infectious. We had a fantastic time, learned a lot, and just genuinely enjoyed the afternoon visiting different areas of Manhattan and munching on pizza from some of his favorite spots.We learned about brick oven vs gas oven pizza preparation, different styles of pizza and how they evolved over time, how pizza came to be in the first place, it's roots in NYC, how to stretch pizza dough the proper way (will be very helpful for when we make pizzas at home!), and visited the manufacturer of a hand crafted pizza oven made right in Soho. My kids were fascinated, and have been saying things like \"That's what Scott would say\" ever since the tour. They loved this guy, and want to send him pizza boxes for his collection, and buy his book whenever it comes out.Oh yeah! We ate good pizza on the tour. My favorite was Lombardi's, but our other two spots-- Pizza Box and John's were tasty, too. Half the people we passed on the street knew Scott and acknowledged him, one older woman embraced him and told us how much she loved him, he obviously was a real \"people person\".  We had a great time, learned a lot, and had a good pizza lunch. Wear comfortable shoes, you're on your feet most of the time. I highly recommend this tour.We booked about a week and a half out, and took the last 3 spots on a Friday tour, so don't wait too long if you have a specific day in mind.", "rating": 5, "name": "Jessica S."}, {"review": "Scott's is a must do tour!So, you think you know the world of pizza?Why is a Margherita Pizza called a Margherita pizza?Did you know  the gluten, protein, and hydration levels of your dough dictate whether you are a 'folder', 'flat', a 'two-hander', or 'knife and fork' eater'?Where is the oldest pizzeria in North America?Where do I purchase a deck oven in Manhattan after the tour?There is a tour that can answer all of these burning questions (and more).Scott's Pizza Tour is probably the most entertaining and informative tour that I have ever taken in NYC, without exaggerationScott's tour will map out the current day pizza landscape as well as cover the significant times, events, and places in NY pizza history.We did the walking tour and next up is the bus tour.This tour is a 'must do' for everyone from the 'recreational' pizza-eater to most hardcore greasy-chinned 'pizz-a-holic'!!A++Nice work Scott!", "rating": 5, "name": "PizzavisionNJ M."}, {"review": "I have to say coming into this I judge the tour too early...

The walks were not long, and of course, your in NYC, so even that part is a blast.  Interesting people in our group who all had one thing in common.
